### Code: Parameter identification and uncertainty propagation of hydrogel coupled diffusion-deformation using POD-based reduced-order modeling

This is the code repository associated with the paper: 'Parameter identification and uncertainty propagation of hydrogel coupled diffusion-deformation using POD-based reduced-order modeling.' All simulations require the FEniCS package. A Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml are included. To reproduce all results, you will need to install Docker and build the Docker image.
